# README

This Toy app is based off of a Ruby Tutorial - It is from chapter 2 of this website:
https://www.railstutorial.org/book

My Website based on this tutorial is deployed here:
https://stormy-citadel-34773.herokuapp.com/

The app does not have a navigation menu as this was not part of my goal.

Here are the links to the pages I created:
https://stormy-citadel-34773.herokuapp.com/users
https://stormy-citadel-34773.herokuapp.com/microposts

Microposts can be created/edited/destroyed and users can be created/edited/destroyed. 
Microposts have been changed to make all posts in caps.
